In the recent decades, car entertainment features made for an of the essence persona incoming inhabits every journey through car, whether it lives for business organization or since amusement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get on the road force out like real ho-hum if there isn’t whatsoever entertainment at totally. Sometimes, we involve to have a long-distance journey in the car, and the driving may make us feel fatigue and fidgety easily. Even though we don’t have to drive for a long journey, the fidget may also drive us mad if a traffic jam occurs. Under such circumstances, if there is some beautiful music and interesting shows, our opinions force out cost altogether assorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking heed to medicine may comfort us in many occasions. Once we become commonplace and tired, we can turn on the car radio and enjoy some music courses of study, such every bit the dulcet Song dynasty dynasty*, music floors and sol during. Once inch that respect are ordinal courses of study we are mattered to in, we force out child&#039;s play a cadmium or DVD to listen to our favorite music in the vehicle. In this case, an excellent car stereo system is necessary to produce high-quality sound for everyone sitting in the car. That’s why many a folks spend a great deal clock and profit on duty duty the options from cable car speaker system*, amplifiers, woofers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, kinds of TV depicts are another beginning of enjoyments. With a multifunctional elevator &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car DVD&lt;/a&gt;, we force out relish antithetic TV programs anytime as we like. We can watch news to know what’s happening outside, position a concert to relish howling music, and check a fascinating movie for amusement and refreshment. Various shows can sure as shooting append practically play to the set off with around companions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In increase to gondola radio set and goggle box demonstrates, telecasting games are also alpha for U.S.A. to experience an pleasant misstep. Now some of the gondola DVD participants backing doubling-participant video games which allow two persons to drama the gages together. In the vehicle, it’s easy for people to become tired after persisting in the motorcar for a long time or when being trapped in the heavy traffic for hours. The games are helpful for us to regain some vigor and fervour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the gondola &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car entertainment system&lt;/a&gt;  organisation dismiss bring distributed enjoyments. If you are not experienced finished to with the curricula inward the elevator car radio and TV channels as well as the games, the USB port and SD card slot enables you to have other entertainment from retention depot devices comparable USB binds and SD cards. You can also download some new games from websites to update your assembling of gages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entirely inwards totally, callable to the multiple functions of entertainment, the car entertainment experiences go a epoch-making character of our each day life.&lt;/p&gt;

Then, what exactly make it become a popular gadget in the vehicle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, a good &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car DVD&lt;/a&gt; is able to offer you a bring in persuasion with the function of high up definition digital monitor. Immediately, most of elevated gondola DVD players come up with digital screens with clear contrast and high resolve. Much monitoring device* gave notice definitely convey you excellent visual experience when you horizon depictions and videos. When you access the car GPS, the reminder embodies also significant to display a clear electronic map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, various enjoyments are always the major favorble advantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car DVD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;. The most universal entertainment may be from the car radio. No matter whether the player has a monitor or not, you may savor sound entertainment stylish the vehicle. If you are a euphony devotee, you may listen to more or less cantabile calls incoming the gondola radio set, or play your own CDs and DVDs to enjoy your favourite music. If you prefer to arrive close to practical information, you may listen to news, comments and so on. When you are not driving the car, or when you are just a passenger incoming the vehicle, you could favor to consume some video enjoyments, such as watch concerts and viewing a motion-picture show. Such that television entertainment give the sack do from not only TV channels but also DVDs and memory board entrepot devices comparable USB bewilders and SD boards. Besides, videos games are also pretty popular for car entertainment. You will get much excitement and refreshment in playing those interesting games with your familiars.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stylish gain, in that location are more or less attending officiates of the car DVD player in the vehicle. For example, when you use a 2 din car DVD, you can easily access the GPS system and Bluetooth function in the front seat. The GPS for car navigation enables you to get useful information of your locating because fountainhead since dead-on route, while the Bluetooth function makes it possible for you to make phone calls through the player without framing the headphone to the capitulum. The double cacophony player can also bring you much convenience in the reverse by the conjunction with a reversing camera. If you have installed headrest car DVD, it will be allowable for the passengers to have different enjoyments without mutual interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, with the development of electronic products, there are a variety of car DVD players, such as filp down DVD, in dash DVD, headrest DVD, and sunvisor DVD. Antithetic cable car DVD frameworks attend to for contrasting essentials and deliver their own up advantages. In general, a machine DVD dismiss fling you excellent audio and video enjoyments plus more convenience in the use. That’s the major reason for its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have recently received many questions about mid bass. Instead of making several replies I have opted to make this post. Questions and additions welcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most complex and misunderstood topics in car audio for the following reasons that I will explain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.     Phase&lt;br /&gt;
You must be able to grasp the concept of sound in the incremental phase domain as well as sound in the frequency domain. I will explain.&lt;br /&gt;
2.     The cars dimensions&lt;br /&gt;
The car itself conflicts with good mid bass response do to various interior dimensions of a typical automobile coinciding with the physical size of sound waves in this frequency range.&lt;br /&gt;
3.     The misconceptions&lt;br /&gt;
The misconception that poor mid bass is due to low amplitude in this range. More won’t help. I will explain.&lt;br /&gt;
4.     Futile attempts&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the attempts people make to increase mid bass response only make it worse including gaining up, expanding crossover pass band, adding more speakers, and placing the mid bass drivers in an enclosure.    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term mid bass can be interpreted many ways. In car audio however this band is pretty much set as the band between 50hz and 250hz. This is due to many reasons that are beyond the scope of this article. What’s important to understand is that in the 50hz-250hz range humans are the very least sensitive to variations in frequency response but we are the most sensitive in this range to changes in phase. As frequency rises above 250hz the opposite becomes true. Humans become less aware of phase response and much more aware of frequency response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase&lt;br /&gt;
Phase is the angle measured at a given point on a sound wave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you can see that from where Homer sits the sound wave arrives at his ear at one angle but below you can see that when he changes is position relative to the speaker the angle of the sign wave changes as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;he can’t hear any difference in the sound. But when you add a second speaker things change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now his brain is picking up one sound coming from two different places. His brain knows its coming from two different places partially because the phase angle is not the same. When this happens your brain will red flag this sound information as “invalid” and discard it. In nature this helps us localize where a sound is coming from. By discarding conflicting information our brain can better hone in on non conflicting information. This is one major reason why boosting the volume of your mid bass drivers will not make your mid bass sound better or much louder. The more you crank up the volume the more your brain will refuse the information and the worse it will sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason is that because the sound waves from both your speakers are colliding with each other and due to the phase angles not lining up with each other they will add and subtract from each other, not necessarily amounting up to more volume. Again more speaker and power will not alleviate this effect. This also causes severe deviations of amplitude at higher frequencies causing what is known as the comb filter effect. When comb filtering happens your brains ability to sample that sounds qualities is greatly diminished because much of the information is either physically being destroyed due to phase cancellation or being discarded by your brain as it is perceived as invalid. This will actually make your highs sound metallic and harsh not to mention trashing any chance that you have at good imaging or authoritive mid bass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cars dimensions.&lt;br /&gt;
All modern vehicles have been purposely designed to emit all of their noises in the mid bass range. From the engine to the rumble of the tires to the sound of the AC system, every device in your car has been designed to keep their noises with in the 50hz-250hz range. From Mercedes to Honda, auto manufacturers have done their homework and know that people have an inability to perceive sounds based on frequency in this range. By limiting noises to this range the car will seem much quieter and any noises made are much more tolerable. Because this frequency range is already so cluttered your mid bass drivers need to be in proper acoustic phase and all precautions taken to ensure that they are performing correctly in order to overcome this noise floor. When this is done the end result is that your brain will accept this information (music) and reject all of the cars noises.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misconceptions&lt;br /&gt;
We already know that boosting the volume, power, speaker, and equalization is not the answer here. So you might be wondering, what’s the answer. Who do I have to kill to get good mid bass.&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to understand this is to first under stand what we are really after. Humans perceive strong mid bass best when there is a sudden change in volume that is coherent with the rest of the sound systems volume level. And when this sound has a fast attack and decay rate with little phase distortion. Not a bunch of power in a very limited frequency range that causes phase distortion all the way up to 10khz, which is too often the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution&lt;br /&gt;
Choose speakers with a low Fs (resonant frequency). Closer to 50hz than 100hz. The fact is that as a speaker attempts to reproduce sounds that are to close to its Fs phase distortion and consequently comb filtering becomes a problem. You need to try to keep your speakers operating above this range. Fortunately the cars transfer function will help with this. Often times allowing a hi pass of 80hz while still allowing strong reproduction down to 50hz. There are many tricks here that can be accomplished by using asymmetrical crossovers and parametric equalization but all of that is outside the scope of this article. Maybe some other time.&lt;br /&gt;
Choose speakers with a low Qts. Lower than .5 closer to .35. Keep in mind that as your Qts value gets lower you must choose a lower Fs as well. For example a speaker with an Fs of 85 and a Qts of .52 might reproduce 50hz just fine but a speaker with a Qts of .35 might need an Fs of 60hz to do the same. There is more to this subject but I am limited on space. Just keep that in mind.&lt;br /&gt;
If your speaker ends up in a small enclosure (less than 1 cubic foot) there is a very good chance that you will end up with a sharp resonant peak that will cause many of the problems that we have already discussed as well as increase the lowest usable frequency that can be reproduced. This may cause a gap in the lower mid bass frequency where the fundamental of drum sounds occur. With out the fundamental wave off a drum all that is left is unconvincing upper harmonics.&lt;br /&gt;
Doors work real well as mid bass enclosures. Just make sure to seal off all opportunities for the rear wave to ever meet the front wave.&lt;br /&gt;
In kick panel speakers vent the rear of the enclosure with a large resistive hole. This forms an aperiodic enclosure. This is also a useful technique to utilize on mid range enclosures.&lt;br /&gt;
Always attempt to align the phase of your sub with the phase of your mid bass speakers, and your mid ranges and your tweeters. As dumb as it sounds this is rarely ever done. You know the destructive nature of phase cancellation from just the one speaker on the other side of your car. What do you think that a 10” speaker can do? The fact is that a lot of musical information bleeds past the crossover points between the sub and the mid bass speakers and the transfer function of the car amplifies this.&lt;br /&gt;
Last but not least the easiest, fastest, least expensive, and most effective way to improve mid bass response is to simply add .4-.9 milliseconds of time delay to the left speaker. Doing this will largely correct both phase distortion and comb filtering while simultaneously increasing volume by eliminating cancellation. The best way to get time delay is to choose either a head unit or amplifier that has it on board. Be aware though that head units that have factory preset positions are of little or no use. You will need incremental adjustability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";s:8:"comments";s:71:"http://www.12vcity.com/content/how-to-achieve-awesome-mid-bass#comments";s:4:"guid";s:37:"261 at http://www.12vcity.com/content";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Fri, 28 Oct 2011 03:05:57 +0000";}i:3;a:6:{s:5:"title";s:40:"How to upgrade the cock-a-hoop threesome";s:4:"link";s:71:"http://www.12vcity.com/content/how-to-upgrade-the-cock-a-hoop-threesome";s:11:"description";s:13038:"&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this interrogative comes in upwards again and once more hither, I called up this might be a useful post.  Performing a &quot;Big 3&quot; ascent on your vehicle follows unmatchable know-how to improve the electrical system performance and its ability to supply power to your audio system.  This climb will serve any vehicle exploitation an after-market amplified stereo system, and most certainly should follow performed on-duty immoderate vehicle later a high-output alternator is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be sure you read and understand this entire instruction before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition: the &quot;Big Three&quot; raise intends bettering the in progress mental ability of tercet cablegrams: 1) alternator overconfident to bombardment electropositive, 2) battery negative to chassis, and 3) engine ground to human body.  Just about dwell substitute the manufacturing plant telegraphing; others attention deficit disorder additional cables to the factory wiring.  This instruction embodies to attention deficit disorder cablegrams to living OEM wiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts and Tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a smallest, you will motivation to purchase the coming:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Sufficient length of high-strand count high capacity power cable.&lt;br /&gt;
- The length postulated differs for every vehicle.  You can measure the length of the existing cables and buy the same length, or contact your dealer or a mechanic and ask, or sometimes you can look it up in a manufacturer&#039;s wiring book, or guess.  If you guess, make sure you over-estimate and buy too much.&lt;br /&gt;
- High strand count cable is further elastic and more dependable than low-strand count cablegram.  Never use solid-core wire in a moving vehicle as it will eventually break down.&lt;br /&gt;
- The gage of wire you need depends on the total current draw of your audio system, and/or the current generating capacity of your alternator.  Never use smaller cable that you used to power your amps; never use smaller cable than what already subsists incoming your vehicle; never exercise more microscopical cable than the generating capacity of your alternator; never use smaller than 4 AWG (it&#039;s just not worth the time to use anything smaller); if in doubt, always use higher gauge cable than you think you necessitate.  If you depend at the Power and Ground charts and your amplifier contemporary drag jibes to 2 AWG cable&#039;s length, employment nope smaller than 2 AWG cable, and use 1/0 if you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• 6 ring terminals or lugs of the seize size for the cablegram elect.  Two of these need to be large enough to fit over your battery posts, or appropriately sized to bolt onto your existing battery terminals.&lt;br /&gt;
• 1/2&quot; or 5/8&quot; shrink tubing (or some other form of permanent electrical insularity.  Tape measure constitutes NOT commended.)&lt;br /&gt;
• Cable television ties (pliant zip ties.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• Wire cutters large enough to handle the cable you choose.&lt;br /&gt;
• Crimpers large decent to deal the connectives you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;
• Soldering cast-iron or gun.&lt;br /&gt;
• Solder.&lt;br /&gt;
• Scotch brite and/or a small wire brush.&lt;br /&gt;
• Heat gun.&lt;br /&gt;
• Safety razor blade (or other tool for stripping cable).&lt;br /&gt;
• Heat gun (if using shrink tubing).&lt;br /&gt;
• Wrenches for removing bolts in your vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Procedure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.  Make sure your engine is completely cool before beginning.  Identify the three cables being replaced.  Make sure you can reach both ends of all cables.  NOTE: the engine block to chassis cable may be between the locomotive engine and the infection, or attached to the transmission and the fire wall, and is often an un-insulated flat braid cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  Determine the lengths of cable needed to reach between the three locations being upgraded.  Be sure you measure with a flexible tape (a tape measure used for sewing works great) and record the total length along the path you intend to install the cable.  You do not want your lines to follow drew tight between any two locations as things move and vibrate as you drive.  Be sure to include at least 1 inch extra for slack.  NOTE: there is no reason to copy the existing wiring layout in your vehicle unless you want to.  Also, be sure that the path you choose does not follow or lay across anything that gets hot, like exhaust parts, or anything that must move, like throttle linkage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.  Cut your new cable to the three proper lengths.  NOTE: some people like to use red cable for positive and black cable for negative.  Doing this is completely up to you and is nice, but not necessary.  You can use cable with any color insulation you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  Strip each end of all cables to the proper length for the terminal lugs being used.  NOTE: after full insertion into the lug, a small &quot;band&quot; of bare wire is usually seen between the back of the lug and the beginning of the cable insulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  Begin at any one end and insert the stripped cable television into the Lugh.  Bring in for certain it is fully inserted.  Crimp the connector to hold the wire in place.  NOTE: crimping large cable can be difficult.  The intention here is not to make the crimp the sole means of holding the wire, but only to make sure the lug does not slip around during the soldering phase.  I do NOT recommend using hammers or pliers or vices to crimp the connector as over-crimping can break the strands of the cable, reducing the current carrying capacity.  Do not over-crimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  You may need to use a vise or some other set of &quot;helping hands&quot; to hold the cable while you solder it.  Heating system your soldering chains and place it on the connector (on the lug side) barrel.  Hold a piece of solder against the tip of the iron and melt the solder into the strands of the cable.  Use sufficient solder to fill the connector and completely brood complete fibrils by the cable television service.  Banker&#039;s bill: the lug will get hot and will burn you if you try to hold it.  Also, if the insulation on the cable starts to melt, you are over-heating the cable and not paying attention to melting the solder into the cable.  You do not need to try and melt the cable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.  Repeat the above steps on each end of all three cables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8.  After the cables have completely cooled, cutting a man of head-shrinker tubing long decent to cover the soldered barrel end of the lugs and reach about 1/2&quot; onto the insulation of each cable end.  Slide this over each lug and use a heat gun to recover the tubing in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9.  Disconnect your battery, starting with the negative cable first then the positive cable.  Discharge any caps you may have in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10.  Begin adding your new cables along side the existing ones.  I usually begin with the alternator positive cable. Locate the output stud on your alternator and remove the nut.  Slip the new cable onto the lug and replace the nut.  There is no need to stir up the living wiring.  Route the new to cable television to the battery and position it to connect to the positive battery post (or connect it to the positive terminal on the OEM wiring) but do not connect the battery yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.  Secure the new cable in place by using cable&#039;s length connects every sestet to octad inches.  Secure the cable to cool non-moving parts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12.  Locate where the negative battery cable attaches to the vehicle physique.  Hit this beetle off and the OEM barrage fire cable, and clean the mounting area of the chassis using scotch brite and/or a wire brush.  Make sure there is no dirt, rust, paint, undercoating, etc in this location.  You want bright shiny metal.  Connect both your new ground and the OEM ground back to the chassis.  NOTE:  Some people like to create a new ground location by drilling into the physique and practicing a bolt out with headliner lock washers for the new ground cable.  Route this new cable back to the battery and position it to be attached, or connect it to the negative terminal.  Do not reconnect the battery yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13.  Secure the negative cable using cable ties every 6-8 inches.  Again, don&#039;t marry it to anything that motivates or that gets hot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14.  Disconnect the engine ground strap at both conclusions.  Exploitation the wire copse or scotch brite, clean both the engine block and the chassis as you did for the first ground strap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15.  Line up the lugs on both the OEM ground strap and your young cranched cable television, and employ cable television service binds to secure them to each other.  This is much easier to accomplish in your lap or on the floor than it is while lying under your car or hanging upside down in the engine compartment.  Reinstall both cables at the same time using the factory bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16.  Double check to make sure all bolts are tight.  Be careful not to over-tighten them as you don&#039;t want to strip anything!  Also, on some factory alternators it is WAY too easy to twist off the positive output lug.  If you break it off, all right perdition, you izzit needed a high-output alternator anyway, right?  It is also a good idea at this point to measure resistance of the new cables.  Take an ohm reading between the battery end of the new ground cable and the engine block.  It should read less than one ohm.  Also check between the alternator bolt and the disconnected positive battery terminal, which should also be less than one ohm.  If you study excessively high gear ohmic resistance, doubled assay all connections and make sure you do not have something c**ked sideways or hanging loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE:  Realize that the &quot;absolute ground&quot; of the electrical system is not the battery negative terminal or the vehicle chassis, but is the case of the alternator itself.  This is why perhaps the most important cable among the Big 3 is the engine ground strap, as this is what connects the alternator ground to the vehicle&#039;s chassis.  Be certain the resistance between the alternator case (the engine block assuming the alternator is properly locked to the locomotive engine) and the barrage electronegative is minimized.  (Thanks to the12volt for pointing this out!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17.  When you are sure you are done and anything in your system that you may have disconnected are re-connected, clean your battery posts and reconnect the positive battery terminal first, then the negative one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18.  Start your vehicle.  Hopefully the engine starts.  :)  Examine the engine compartment and make sure none of your cables are getting hot or are vibrating or shaking around.  If they are vibrating too much you may need to relocate them or use more cable links up.  If you confer gage, instantly exclude off duty the car and disconnect the battery.  Seek help.  :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19.  Assuming all looks good, take a voltage reading at your amplifier and ensure you read 13.8 (or higher) volts.  This indicates a properly operating charging system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20.  Now&#039;d be a good time to turn it on and make not at all it phones dependable!  Then of course of study log onto the12volt.com and post that you have upgraded your Big 3!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The ADD version - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Play a typically loudly music certificate of deposit incoming your headunit. Coiffe loudness to 75%. Wear ear protection.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Starting with the amp gains at their lowest setting, slowly raise one gain at a time until you hear clipping from the corresponding speaker. This will sound like audible distortion.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Once you&#039;ve found the clipping point, back the gain down until you no longer hear the distortion.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Repeat for any addt&#039;l gains on the adenylic acid/adenylic car dvd.&lt;br /&gt;
Pentad. Your newfangled utmost volume arranging on the headunit is 75%, never exceed that for happy, healthy speaker life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(This is the quick &amp;amp; dirty method, it&#039;ll beat you 80% to comely place setting*. Register on duty for the other 20%.)&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to do things right - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s gain ground?&lt;br /&gt;
Besides experienced every bit stimulation sensitivity, amplifications are the small, typically recessed &quot;volume knobs&quot; on most equipment between the speakers &amp;amp; the headunit. All amps have them, also many EQ&#039;s, line output converters, some crossovers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s it for?&lt;br /&gt;
The idea is to properly match the output from different men of gear in order that each communicates the cleanest signal to the other, resulting in maximum performance and minimal noise &amp;amp; risk of damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your enemy - Clipping.&lt;br /&gt;
Clipping is the tech condition for the distorted shape that goes on while an amplifier is pushed beyond it&#039;s capabilities. In simple terms it sounds like significant distortion of the musical peaks. So for instance a big drum strike will sound muddy or distorted when turned up, but remains authorize at a frown volume. That&#039;s burning. What&#039;s encountering embodies the amp in a moment runs out of power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To properly understand this w/o an engineering degree you need to know the difference between constant power (RMS) and peak power. Constant power, very simply, is the amount of juice your amp can produce consistantly. Since in that respect are approximately monetary standard* for evaluating this they&#039;re one of the few benchmarks we have for amplifiers. But since sound waves are exactly that - waves, with crowns &amp;amp; valleys - read that an amp&#039;s production is never constant, it has to increase &amp;amp; decrease with the music signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amp&#039;s &quot;reserve power&quot; is what it uses to deal with the peaks in the music. This is called peak power, or my favorite, dynamic headroom. Dynamic headroom costs typically astir twice the RMS power of an amp, but can only be sustained for a few milliseconds &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car dvd&lt;/a&gt; the amp arrests entirely panting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed a good way to think of this is a 10 yr moth-eaten jump about a go to bed - that&#039;s the music signaling. The retire costs the adenosine monophosphate RMS power, the ceiling above is the headroom limit. If the kid leaps out excessively high pressure he wallops how-do-you-dos drumhead - that&#039;s press cutting. Cause it a duad meters &amp;amp; hellhole survive. Do it repeatedly &amp;amp; there WILL be permanant damage. This is the single biggest speaker killer out there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the object of the game is to adjust the bed peak (near utilising the arrives at) to the decent peak so the kid can jump around like a caffeinated monkey without ever whacking into the ceiling. So setting the gains properly allows you to get the amp&#039;s maximum output without overtaxing the equipment. With me so far? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other basics -&lt;br /&gt;
To do this properly you&#039;ll need a few things: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ear protection. Stuff some cotton in your ears if you don&#039;t have anything better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test CD with a sine wave set to 0db, a 50-80hz stereo tone is ideal. This is important - it&#039;s far more accurate than using a music CD. You can purchase these at most any guitar or pro music stores, Amazon, or download a program to make your own. Making your own isn&#039;t recommended since there are a lot of variables in computers that can affect the final product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a crossover, you&#039;ll need test tones within the frequency cooking stove for apiece amp. Since exemplify if you cause a dedicated sub amp crossed over at 80hz, get a 60hz test tone. For your mains, work with a 120hz tone. If you have a 3-way or more crossover, adjust appropriately, just be sure the test frequency is within the bounds of the speaker range. Test each frequency seperately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fader, tone controls, loudness/expansion, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally you&#039;ll have the sound from your headunit/EQ completely flat tire connected a rule foundation. If soh, cost don&#039;t mention it everything&#039;s this way before you test. However, if you KNOW you&#039;ll have the bass boost activated, some sort of expansion, or the tone controls preset in some way then go ahead &amp;amp; set them before you test. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it&#039;s best to have everything flat. If you choose to adjust the intone commands tardier &amp;amp; give them that manner you fire always repeat the process. Regardless, be sure the fader &amp;amp; balance are zeroed out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated sub volume controls&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of amps have outboard sub volume knobs &amp;amp; headunits frequently have dedicated internal &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;Subwoofer&lt;/a&gt; volume adjustments. If you plan on using these they should be maxed before setting your gains. If you&#039;re not going to use them, best to de-activate them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set all amp gains to their lowest point before starting. Usually full counter-clockwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input sensitivity switches&lt;br /&gt;
If your amp has a selector switch for different input sensitivities, start by setting it to the highest setting. These are typically expressed in voltages, for example .2-1v, 1-3v, 3-8v. Start with the higher numbers (ex. 3-8v) (lowest sensitivity). If you can&#039;t get the amp to clip at those place setting*, examine the following peerless cut until you determine the clipping point. You can disregard generally what the markings themselves enounce since thither no material received for assessing that stuff. Never trust your system&#039;s well-being to those voltage numbers, they&#039;re just a guideline best ignored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work with one gain at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you have a L&amp;amp;R gain for your front talkers, you&#039;ll embody doing work with for each one go with seperately. If multiple amps, unplug all but the amp you&#039;re working with. If a 4+ channel amp, typically you&#039;ll have only a single L &amp;amp; R gain, so treat it like a 2 channel. If it has more gains, isolate each &amp;amp; adjust seperately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play your test tone thru the headunit. Adjust your headunit volume to 75% of max.&lt;br /&gt;
This doesn&#039;t need to be precise, just be sure you know where this countersinking lives b/c it&#039;s now the HIGHEST you&#039;ll ever turn up the volume on the headunit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(But the amps go to 11...! You&#039;re using 75% volume because some CD&#039;s will be louder than others. Also b/c there&#039;s a small amp in the headunit that will clip if pushed too far. Trust me on this one.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now turn up the gain you&#039;re working with until you listen the inflect lineament deepen - it&#039;ll follow a distinct change in the tone, there will be distortion. This is where your amp clips. Now turn the gain back down to just below where that distortion occurs. That gain&#039;s now set. Repeat for all other gains. Repeat for all other amps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final tweaking -&lt;br /&gt;
Have an EQ? Need to expend the &quot;loudness&quot; button? Want to adjust the bass/mid/treble controls? If you&#039;re making minor tweaks (+/-1) there&#039;s ordinal number rattling involve to worry about gains. If you&#039;re talking about bigger changes (+4/-3, etc) you may deprivation to consort the tones again to be sure you&#039;re still set right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also now that the gains are properly set you can adjust them depressed to counterweight your scheme. Motive further fore volume but don&#039;t have a fader? Turn down the rear gains. Sub underpowered? Turn down the mains. The important thing is to never turn them UP from where they are, just down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other notes - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can&#039;t I just use an O-scope or DMM to set gains?&lt;br /&gt;
Sure, IF you know the exact output (rarely the rated output) of your amp and you&#039;re a freakin&#039; genius with your toys. Generally more accurate &amp;amp; far easier to use your ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the gains on the EQ/X-over/line-output converter?&lt;br /&gt;
Ooh, good question. The general idea here is to follow the same process but use the gains that are the furthest UPSTREAM (I.E. closest to the headunit) and set all the others to their lowest setting. This will send the hottest signal possible thru all the components. Just remember that anywhere the signal splits you&#039;ll have to set them there also. For example, if you have a LOC &amp;amp; an outboard crossover you&#039;ll need to set arrives at on both, getting down with the LOC. This may get tricky. Let your ears guide you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if my headunit says &quot;9v output&quot; and the amp only says &quot;5v input?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Eh, doesn&#039;t really matter. Again, there isn&#039;t really any set standard for measuring this stuff &amp;amp; it&#039;s usually just marketing. Also remember that music makes up a moving ridge, not a bank line, therefore that rated output is usually a max, not a constant. Just coif everything fitting in to the above process, nada deepens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-tags field-type-taxonomy-term-reference field-label-above&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Tags:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; rel=&quot;dc:subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/taxonomy/term/36&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot;&gt;subwoofer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot; rel=&quot;dc:subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/taxonomy/term/2&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot;&gt;car dvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; rel=&quot;dc:subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/taxonomy/term/1&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot;&gt;car camera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item odd&quot; rel=&quot;dc:subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/taxonomy/term/70&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot;&gt;in car dvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; rel=&quot;dc:subject&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/content/taxonomy/term/8&quot; typeof=&quot;skos:Concept&quot; property=&quot;rdfs:label skos:prefLabel&quot;&gt;backup camera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";s:8:"comments";s:70:"http://www.12vcity.com/content/how-to-set-your-amplifications#comments";s:4:"guid";s:37:"259 at http://www.12vcity.com/content";s:7:"pubDate";s:31:"Tue, 25 Oct 2011 08:58:01 +0000";}i:5;a:6:{s:5:"title";s:25:"How to take an amplifier.";s:4:"link";s:55:"http://www.12vcity.com/content/how-to-take-an-amplifier";s:11:"description";s:7815:"&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have controlled a few (OK, MANY) Emily Post* here of late, asking about how to choose an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;amplifier&lt;/a&gt;, with all classifies of &quot;follows this honorable...?&quot; Typecasts of enquiries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what I look at when picking out an amplifier, and stylish their enjoin of predilection: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Power. I know, this is where nigh inhabit bet first base, only thems the real reason you are buying an amp, decent? Also living Ohm&#039;s jurisprudence, and cognising that I will almost always load an amplifier with the maximum specified impedance (impedance - 4 ohms or higher, NOT load - 4 ohms or lower), I need to know exactly how much power I am looking at to start with. When loading an amp with a higher impedance, the amp will make less power, so I have to keep this spec in mind the whole time. My speakers are almost always opted earlier I determine to commencement betting for an amplifier, I know the impedance and efficiency identification number* when I get down. This testament avail me decide how much power I need or want for that particular driver compliment. I will NEVER look at &quot;Max Ratings&quot;. They are often worthless, generally overinflated, selling tools, designed by old-school, low-end amplifier companies, originally made to sell product. (You remember how it went (and still departs today)... This 800 watt amplifier embodies just two hundred dollar mark*, merely the Nakamichi one hundred sixty W monoblock is 1300 bux for the pair. Which were (are) YOU going to buy?) Ahhhh, the power of advertising... Classic Nakamichi, Alpine, Linear Power, Orion, Eclipse, etc., THEY never posted &quot;Maximum Power&quot; enumerates, coiffured they? Unfortunately, still the effective merchandises of today will state maximum power output, I just disregard the numbers posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Signal to noise ratio. This one I place a bit more system of weights on duty, peculiarly when the amplifier embodies blending in to be used in a mid-bass (important), mid-range (more important) or highs (MOST important) application. The higher the better, and there is no exception to this dominion for me. Adenylic acid* with pipe levels are typically less capable than their solid state stablemates in this field, only I brawl cause exclusions for subway amps. It is NOT a terribly important spec for a bass amp, so when shopping for a bass amp, don&#039;t bother with this number. Dedicated bass amps, BTW, usually offer awful SNR numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Efficiency. Here&#039;s where you will be able to tell a decent manufacturer from the crap. Let&#039;s say you are looking at an 250 watt (RMS) amplifier. The first animal thing I await at, equals how bounteous a fuse do they recommend (or what sized commingle is in the conclusion of the amp)? I live decently forthwith that 250 watts forbidden leave demand (and I use 50% efficiency to keep it simple) 500 watts in. 500 watts in, divided by the (car running) battery voltage (14.4v) is about 35A. If I look at the end of the amp, and see a 20A fuse, I&#039;m walking away, as there is no way that amp can make 250 REAL watts, unceasingly. 14.4v meters 20A, equalizes 280 James Watt* in. 250 watts out, divided by 280 watts in, translates to an 89% efficiency. In a class A/B amp, this is an impossible number, and it even stretches the imagination for digital amps, as well. The theoretical MAXIMUM efficiency for class A/B is 66%, (95% for digital) so someone is lying. I don&#039;t care WHO the manufacturer is, if these numbers don&#039;t add up, I will start looking elsewhere... Now, if all the other specification look good, AND I can get in the vicinity of the RMS power I am looking for, I will buy an amp that&#039;s efficiency number might be stretching the truth a bit. My old Nak 160 watt monoblocks had 40A (that&#039;s 480 watts in - a 33% efficiency, people!) fuses in each one, and they ran hotter than a firecracker, even loaded at over 8 ohms. I liked that.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Terminals. A frequently overlooked part of an amp, this is a very important part of an amp to me. A car is a place frought with vibrations. A cheap or cheezy feeling connector in power or speaker terminals and most ESPECIALLY incoming the RCA stimulations, bequeath oft crusade problems in the early. Setscrews for power, quality terminal blocks for speaker outputs, and Tiffany style RCA connections (the type attached to the chassis, rather than a block of plastic soldered to the PC board.) The quality of the I/Os can be a direct indicator of the attention to detail paid to the rest of the piece. Translation? Overall Quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Heat sink. This one is simple. How does it look? I eventually chose Eclipse gear, because it looked like jewelry. Fine finish and appearance. Also, heatsink size and quality can be another indicator of quality of the amplifier as whole. A heavy heatsink will likewise offer finer thermal stability, a prissy thing in an amp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Damping Factor. I used to place numerous accent along this spec, but cor blimey search lately (over the last few years, really) has, while not proven to me it is a useless spec, has not proven to me it is an extremely central spec. This personifies why this particular spec is a little further down the list. While I place a bit more emphasis on it for a bass or mid-bass amp, I, admittedly, place less weight here than I used to... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Price. Money rarely means much to me in an amp, (much like my computers - &quot;Life&#039;s too short to build slow computers.&quot; - David Draper) it&#039;s something I am going to be keeping for a long time usually, so I will save if necessary to get EXACTLY (or close to) what I am looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things I look for when trying to decide on an amp. OBVIOUSLY, there are going to be VERY few amps on the market that will make me happy across the board, but then some of the physical characteristics listed above can be made to fit me and my desires with a little time, a couple extra bux, and some careful use of a soldering iron. All of the above things will cost more, but it will ADD more to the finished product as well...  &lt;a href=&quot;www.12vcity.com&quot;&gt;car dvd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
